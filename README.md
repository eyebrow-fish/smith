# smith

**An ordinary guy in a not so ordinary world**

**smith** is a simple 2D game written in [Go](https://golang.org) and [ebiten](https://ebiten.org).

## development

Currently, this game is just being written for fun. There are no direct goals with the development, but I do hope to
have something resembling a finished product at some point.
